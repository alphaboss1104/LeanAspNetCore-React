# LeanAspNetCore
A 'lean' ASP.NET Core 2.1 app that uses Razor Pages for server pages and npm and webpack for client assets.

## Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/martijnboland/LeanAspNetCore.git
cd LeanAspNetCore
dotnet run
```
At the first run, it takes a little while before all dependencies are resolved. Just have a little patience. It's only one time.
